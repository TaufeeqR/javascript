##Introduction into JavaScript
```

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things/change to your web page/s. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at such as displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc, you can say that JavaScript is involved.
