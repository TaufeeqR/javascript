# JAVASCRIPT


## Introduction into JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things/change to your web page/s. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at such as displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc, you can say that JavaScript is involved.

##  VARIABLES

A variable is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, we need to use the let or var keyword.
